# Project Planning and Design

**Chapter 3: Setting Up the "Trending Now" Kitchen ‚Äì Project Planning & Design**

*(Progress Label: üìçBlueprint in Hand: Schematics for Our Project's Kitchen)*

### üßë‚Äçüç≥ Introduction: From Grand Vision to Kitchen Schematics

In Chapter 1, we "Crafted the Vision" for our "Trending Now" application, defining its business purpose and framing the core ML problem of genre classification. Chapter 2 then "Designed the Michelin-Grade Kitchen," outlining the MLOps blueprint, core principles, essential capabilities, and strategic considerations for any robust ML operational setup. We established that a successful MLOps kitchen isn't just about individual recipes but about the entire system of operation.

Now, with a clear restaurant concept (Chapter 1) and a comprehensive understanding of how an MLOps kitchen *should* operate (Chapter 2), it's time to draw up the specific schematics for *our* "Trending Now" kitchen. This chapter is where we translate high-level strategy into a tangible project plan. We'll finalize the menu (Product Requirements), sketch the diner's journey (User Flow), select our specific kitchen appliances (Tech Stack), design the workflow for each dish preparation (Pipeline Design), and organize our kitchen stations (Environment Strategy, CI/CD, and Directory Structure).

This detailed planning phase is indispensable. Just as a chef wouldn't start cooking without a well-thought-out plan for their kitchen and menu, we won't dive into coding our pipelines without a clear roadmap. This chapter will produce the foundational documents and plans that will guide the development and implementation of the "Trending Now" application throughout the rest of this study guide. Let's get our aprons on and start designing our specific kitchen setup!

### üßë‚Äçüç≥ Conclusion: Schematics Approved, Ready to Build the Kitchen!

With Chapter 3, we've moved from the strategic MLOps blueprint to a concrete project plan for our "Trending Now" application. We've finalized the application's features and user flow (the menu and diner experience), locked in our technology choices (the kitchen appliances), designed the core data and ML pipelines (the food preparation lines), and outlined our environment, CI/CD, and organizational strategies (the kitchen's operational workflow).

These detailed schematics ‚Äì the PRD, User Flow, Tech Stack, Pipeline Designs, and Implementation Plan ‚Äì are not just academic exercises. They are the essential guides that will direct our construction efforts in the subsequent chapters. Just as a well-planned kitchen layout and process flow are vital for a restaurant's success, this comprehensive project plan ensures our MLOps journey is structured, focused, and aligned with our learning objectives.

We are now fully equipped to start the hands-on work. In the next chapter, we'll roll up our sleeves and begin the first critical phase of any data-driven project: sourcing and understanding the raw ingredients ‚Äì our data.
